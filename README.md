## User Story
AS an outdoor enthusiast 
I WANT to search for hiking trails, biking trails and campsites from a website
SO THAT I can plan my outdoor trips.

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a hiking and campsite searching website
WHEN I search a city
THEN I am presented with available hiking trails, biking trails and campsites
WHEN I click on a displayed hiking trail, biking trail or campsite
THEN I am given a Google map of the location where directions can be accessed

## Description
This web application was made to locate trails and campsites around a city of your choice. This was a project for a fullstack development bootcamp through the University of Washington. We hope this website gets you into the great outdoors!

## Usage

When the web application loads, you are presented with a beautiful image of a locally captured trail in the woods. Below, there is a search bar where you are prompted to search for a city of your choosing. Right now, the web application is able to search for cities only; an idea for future development could be to implement different search criteria for the user.

As shown below, a search of the word "seattle" pulls results of local hiking trails, biking trails and campsites within a 25 mile proximity to the city. When the search button is clicked, the city name is stored to the local storage of the user's machine. In future development, we plan to incorporate the use of searched criteria with Google analytics to create reports that provide insights into the usage of our web application. The data is pulled using our first server side api, TrailAPI, and is organized and appended into clickable cards in three different columns. Each card has the title of the trail or campsite, a description of trail or campsite, and instructions to click the card to pull up directions via Google Maps.

Below is an example of the map that is loaded into a seperate tab once a card is clicked. In this case, I clicked the card of "Camp Long". To do this, we made a click event on the appended card using Google Maps Embed API based on the name derived from TrailAPI.

The next two screenshots show our About section, where we list who contributed to the project, which API we used and give photo credit. We recieved permission to use the photographs displayed on the web application.
